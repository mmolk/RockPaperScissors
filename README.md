# RockPaperScissors
A simple well known game of Rock-Paper-Scissors made in a single .java file. No classes, no objects only pure procedural programming.

The program takes the users input and competes against the "CPU-s" choice. The algorythm chooses the CPU-s choice by random.
It also counts score - the first one to reach 3 points wins.

The program runs in a console but has a very simple "graphic output". Some parts of the program are printed using a system delay (Thread.sleep function) for a more genuine "use experience".
